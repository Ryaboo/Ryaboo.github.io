<h1>What Is Music All About?</h1>

<p>Music has and will always be a major part of culture in any section of the world.  Even back before technology was a more understood topic, music prevailed through
    different instruments the people at the time could create.  Fast forward to the present day and we have more instruments than most people can even imagine.  With all these instruments 
    at our fingertips, its hard not to be interested in them!  Whether or not you think you have the talent, anyone can pick up a musical instrument.  Even if you
    do not enjoy the first one you try, or you aren't good at first, do not give up!  They take time and practice and sometimes the more obscure instruments are the ones that suite you!
