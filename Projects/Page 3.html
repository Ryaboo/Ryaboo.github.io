    <p>All of these instruments are just some of the ones people tend to pick up.  Obviously drums, piano, guitar, and bass are the most common
        for people looking to start a band or pick up an easy instrument.  Although, there are plenty more instruments than the ones listed that many people use in many songs.
        For example, a synthesizer is a common instrument used in 80's music that people often overlook.  Much like a piano, it can be played on a keyboard
        and is great for making unique, retro sounds!

    sound to near perfection.  Most famous music in our current times are made from upwards of 20 or more people depending on the artist!  If you are interested in learning more about bands, <a href="c:\Users\ninja\OneDrive\Desktop\Music Management Directory\page 4.html">Click Here</a>!
